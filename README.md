This is a small Google Chrome extension that allows you to generate strong and secure passwords using the well known Diceware algorithm.

# Instructions
Just enter the number of words you want and the separator (if any!) and press the green button. It will generate you a brand new password.

### Optional
You can choose the [EFF] word list or the original Diceware, by [Arnold Reinhold]. The default is the [EFF] one.

# Geek stuff
This plugin uses Vanilla JS. In other words: no third party libraries are being used.

There's no way to know which password you generated but if you're paranoid you can disconnect from the Internet and the extension will work the same way.

# FAQS
- What's the objective of this extension?
    - This extension uses the diceware method to generate secure passwords / passphrases. I build it just for fun but it can be used in real life applications such as generating your password manager vault password.
- Is it meant to replace password managers?
    - No way!
- Is it safe?
    - Absolutely! Everything is done inside your browser. You can even use it offline.
- Why is the default number of words 8?
    - According to diceware method creator: **"Eight words should be completely secure through 2050."**
